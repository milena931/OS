An asynchronous operating system kernel for a RISC-V processor, implemented in C++. 
The system includes essential system calls for memory management, thread management, and semaphore handling.
The operating system is designed to support efficient multitasking by enabling concurrent execution of threads, while managing resources 
and synchronization through semaphores.
